## Introduction

Unikernels is a promising technology that can achieve extremely fast boot times,
a smaller memory footprint, increased performance, and more robust security than
containers. Therefore, Unikernels could be very useful in cloud deployments,
especially for microservices and function deployments. However, Unikernels are
notorious for being difficult to build and even deploy them.

In order to provide a user-friendly build process for unikernels and let the
users build and use them as easy as containers we build `bunny`. The main goal
of `bunny` is to provide a unified and simplified process of building and
packaging unikernels. With `bunny`, a user can simply build an application as a
unikernel and even package it as an OCI image with all
necessary metadata to run it with [urunc](https://github.com/nubificus/urunc).

`bunny` is based on [pun](https://github.com/nubificus/pun) a tool that packages
already built unikernels in OCI images for `urunc`. This functionality is and
will be supported from `bunny` as well. However, `bunny` is also able to build
unikernels from scratch.

## The `bunnyfile`

In order to instruct `bunny` how to build and package unikernels, we have
defined a yaml-based file, called `bunnyfile`. You can think of `bunnyfile` as
the equivalent of `Dockerfile` for containers. The currently supported fields of
the `bunnyfile` are the following:

```

### The `rootfs` field

The unikernel and libOS landscape is very diverse and each framework/technology
comes with its own support for storage. The users can easily get lost on the
various storage technologies that each framework supports. For that purpose, `bunny`
aims to provide a common interface to let the users easily define the contents
of the unikernel's rootfs. Hence, let's take a closer look on this part of
`bunnyfile`.

#### The `from` field

In this field, we can instruct `bunny` to use an existing rootfs file or create
one. It is similar to the Dockerfile's `FROM` instruction, but in `bunny` it is
also used to define the location of an existing rootfs file.
The `from` field can have one of the following values:

- **scratch**: `bunny` will build the rootfs from scratch (starting with an empty
  directory).
- **local**": we can use this value to use an existing rootfs file that resides in
  the local build context of `bunny`.
- **OCI image**: an OCI image to use as a base for the rootfs, or an OCI image
  that contains an existing rootfs file.

#### The `path` field

This field makes sense only when we define "local" or "OCI image" in the `from`
field. In the `path` field users should define the path where an existing rootfs
file resides. Tsuch cases could be a rootfs file (e.g. initrd, virtio-block,
etc.) created locally or reusing one from another OCI image.

#### The `type` field

Some unikernel frameworks, or similar technologies, support a single type of
storage and hence this field is quite useless. If that is the case, `bunny` will
print the respective error message. On the other hand, some frameworks support
more than one storage types. For instance, Linux can use an initramfs, a
virtio-block or even shared-fs as the rootfs. These are the cases were this
field is useful. Users can choose (if they wish) a specific type of rootfs and
`bunny` will build it. Currently, `bunny` can create the following types:

- **initrd**: A typical cpio file that guests can use as an initial rootfs.
- **block**: A block image that can be used as a rootfs.
- **raw**: In this case `bunny` does not build any specific kind of file, but
  instead copies the files, that the user specifies, directly in the OCI image's
  rootfs. This type is useful when we want to pass the entire OCI image's rootfs
  to the guest, either through share-fs or devmapper.

#### The `include` field

In this field users can define the files from the local build context that they
want to include in the rootfs. It is equivalent to the `COPY` instruction in
Dockerfile. The field accepts a list of entries with the following format:

```
- <path_in the_local_build_context>:<path_inside_the_rootfs>
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Except of the `bunnyfile`, `bunny` supports the Dockerfile-like
> file that

> and
> [bima](https://github.com/nubificus/bima?tab=readme-ov-file#how-bima-works)
> takes as input. However, the Dockerfile-like syntex is limited only to

## Containerfile-like syntaxes

In addition to the `bunnyfile`, `bunny` also supports building OCI images using a
traditional Containerfile-like syntax. However, in this format, `bunny` can only
package existing files; it does not support generating or modifying them. As a
result, the set of supported instructions is limited to the following:

- `FROM`: Specifies the base image, it can be an existing OCI image or `scratch`
- `COPY`: Functions similarly to Containerfiles and copies the specified files
   in the container's rootfs as a new layer..
- `LABEL`: all LABEL *instructions* are added as annotations to the container's
  image. These are also embedded into a special `urunc.json` file inside the
  image root filesystem.
- `ENV`: Sets environment variables
- `CMD`: Defines the command-line arguments for the application.
- `ENTRYPOINT`: Specifies the container’s entrypoint.

As with `bunnyfile`, using this syntax requires a special BuildKit directive at
the top of the file:

```
#syntax=harbor.nbfc.io/nubificus/bunny:latest
```

## Trying it out

The easiest and most effortless way to try out `bunny` would be using it as a
buildkit's frontend. Therefore, assuming that we have an existing Unikraft
unikernel with its initrd already prebuilt, we can package everything as an OCI
image for [urunc](https://github.com/nubificus/urunc) with the following
`bunnyfile`:

```
#syntax=harbor.nbfc.io/nubificus/bunny:latest
version: v0.1

platforms:
  framework: unikraft
  version: 0.17.0
  monitor: qemu
  architecture: x86

rootfs:
  from: local
  path: initramfs-x86_64.cpio

kernel:
  from: local
  path: kernel

cmd: ["/server"]
```

We can then package everything with the following command:

```
docker build -f bunnyfile -t harbor.nbfc.io/nubificus/urunc/httpc-unikraft-qemu:test .
```

The above `bunnyfile` will perform the following steps:
1. Copy the file `initramfs-x86_64.cpio` from the local build context to an
   empty OCI image at `/boot/rootfs`.
2. Copy the file `kernel` from the local build context to the OCI image we used
   in the previous step at `/boot/kernel`.
3. Set up [`urunc`'s annotations](https://urunc.io/image-building/#annotations)
   using all the information in the file (e.g. framework, version, cmd,
   binary, initrd).
4. Produce the final OCI image.

For more examples, please take a look in the [examples
directory](https://github.com/nubificus/bunny/tree/main/examples/README.md)..

## Supported frameworks

Currently, `bunny` is available on GNU/Linux for both x86\_64 and arm64
architectures. Its primary goal is to build and package unikernels as OCI
images. The packaging process is framework-agnostic, meaning `bunny` can be
used with any unikernel framework or similar technology.

While support for building unikernels is underway, it is currently experimental and not yet merged into the main branch. We are actively working on it. That said, `bunny` can already be used to build root filesystems (rootfs) for certain unikernels.

The table below summarizes the current support for various unikernels and frameworks:

| Unikernel  | Build    | Rootfs              |
|----------- |--------- |-------------------  |
| Rumprun    | :hammer: | block / raw         |
| Unikraft   | :hammer: | initrd / raw        |
| MirageOS   | :hammer: | block /raw          |
| Mewz       | :hammer: | No support          |
| Linux      | :hammer: | initrd / block /raw |


Even if a framework is not listed above, specifying one of the supported rootfs types
will be enough for `bunny` to create or handle such a root filesystem
and subsequently package everything as an OCI image with the necessary
annotations for urunc

We plan to continuously expand support for additional unikernel frameworks and
similar technologies. Feel free to [contact](#contact) us for a specific
unikernel framework or similar technologies that `bunny` could support.

## Execution modes

`bunny` supports two modes of execution: either a) local execution, printing a
LLB, or b) as a frontend for Docker's buildkit. The easiest way is to use it as
a frontend.

### As buildkit's frontend

In order to use `bunny` as Buildkit's frontend, we just need to add a new
line in the top of the Dockerfile. In particular, every file that we want to
use for 'bunny' needs to start with the following line.

```
#syntax=harbor.nbfc.io/nubificus/bunny:latest
```

Then, we can just execute docker build as usual. Buildkit will fetch an image
containing `bunny` and it will use it as a frontend. Therefore, anyone can use
`bunny` directly without even building or installing its binary.

### Using buildctl

In order to use `bunny` with buildctl, we have to build it locally, run it and then feed
its output to buildctl.

#### How to build

We can easily build `bunny` by simply running make:

```
make
```

> **_NOTE:_**  `bunny` was created with Golang version 1.23.4

#### How to use

In the case of buildctl, `bunny` does not produce any artifact by itself.
Instead, it outputs a LLB that we can then feed in buildctl. 
Therefore, in order to use `bunny`, we need to firstly install buildkit.
For more information regarding building and installing buildkit, please refer
to buildkit
[instructions](https://github.com/moby/buildkit?tab=readme-ov-file#quick-start).

As long as buildkit is running in our system, we can use `bunny`
with the following command:
```
./bunny --LLB -f bunnyfile | sudo buildctl build ... --local context=<path_to_local_context> --output type=<type>,<type-specific-args>
```

`bunny` takes as an argument the `bunnyfile` a
yaml file with instructions to build and package unikernels. For more
information regarding bunnyfile please check the [respective
section](#Bunnyfile)

Regarding the buildctl arguments:
- `--local context` specifies the directory of the local context. It is similar
  to the build context in the docker build command.  Therefore, if we specify
  want to copy any file from the host, the path should be relative to the
  directory of this argument.
- `--output type=<type>` specifies the output format. Buildkit supports various
  [outputs](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#output).
  Just for convenience we mention the `docker` output, which produces an output
  that we can pass to `docker load` in order to place our image in the local
  docker registry. We can also specify the name of the image, using the
  `name=<name` in the `<type-specific-option>`.

For instance:

```
./bunny --LLB -f bunnyfile | sudo buildctl build ... --local context=/home/ubuntu/unikernels/ --output type=docker,name=harbor.nbfc.io/nubificus/urunc/built-by-bunny:latest | sudo docker load
```
